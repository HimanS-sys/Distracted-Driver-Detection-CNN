**Project description** : Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) to detect whether the driver is attentive using in-car camera images.

Our team ConvHeads - Chaitanya, Himanshu, Aayush, Samyak has worked on this project as a part of [Univ.Ai](https://www.univ.ai/)'s AI-2 week long final project. Please find the repository [here](https://github.com/penguinKAL/Distracted-Driver-Detection-CNNs/).

Whether we are driving or in a passenger seat, we have seen drivers being distracted by a text on a phone, reaching behind for something, or having to attend a phone call.<br/>

According to [U.S Department of Transportation](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812926), Every day about 8 people in the United States are killed in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.

We think that having a system that alerts the driver if they are distracted, is the need of the hour. We intend to do this using Convolutional Neural Networks and classify the drivers actions into 10 classes- safe driving, texting - right,talking on the phone - right, texting - left, talking on the phone - left, operating the radio, drinking, reaching behind, hair and makeup, talking to passenger.

## Results
The model predictions on real world images collected by us can be seen below.
